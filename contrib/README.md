[testfuzz.sh](./testfuzz.sh) | A script to fuzz the ./testre program. | Michael Tesch, tesch1@gmail.com

### testfuzz.sh

This script fuzzes the ./testre program using the handy [AFL (american
fuzzy lop)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).  If AFL isn't available
it will be downloaded and built locally.
